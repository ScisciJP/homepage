Arguably the biggest source of issues with peer review quality is the lack of incentives to invest more work in invisible service labor, and improving the incentives for that was one of the missions of ACL'23. 

With support of ACL exec, we are pleased to announce the inaugural round of ACL reviewer awards, which will be comparable in scope to the best paper awards policy (1-1.5% of the pool of reviewers and chairs). Besides serving as a token of community recognition, and they come with a special award: a fee waiver for any *ACL virtual conference, to be used within a year of the award. Since most academic institutions cover attendance for the conferences where their affiliated authors have accepted papers—but not other conferences—-we hope that this will allow the awardees to attend more conferences than they would otherwise, and the benefit of the award will thus be received by them rather than by their host institutions.

The reviewers are nominated for awards by their area chairs, whom we asked to recognize the reviewers providing extra helpful reviews or high-quality emergency reviews, "champion'' reviewers, and reviewers who were particularly active in the discussion phase, and demonstrated exceptional open-mindedness or expertise. We also asked the Senior Area chairs to nominate exceptional area chairs, and finally we as PCs also nominated the SACs of the track that was the most on-time with its tasks, provided the most helpful feedback, and followed our instructions the most closely. In total, we have 67 awards. 

Here's a few of our favorite reviewer nomination pitches:

> _Although the paper was neither sound nor exciting, they took the time to write very specific and detailed comments along with constructive feedback and suggestions._ 

> _They wrote good enthusiastic reviews and actively participated in the discussion, acknowledging and taking into account other reviewers, as well as clarifying their own stance._

> _This reviewer not only submitted thorough and helpful review, but also followed up on the authors' response and provided convincing arguments for why the paper should be accepted._

> _They responded very promptly, humbly, and with an open mind to my request to fix some review policy issues before the author response. As a result, they revised their review to be very balanced while keeping a friendly and encouraging tone._

> _This reviewer did a thorough emergency review in one day, she is a hero :)_

> _They volunteered to do an emergency review and wrote detailed reviews for both papers they reviewed in my batch. Additionally, they proactively started discussing with the other reviewers after the rebuttal, pushing back on some of the other reviewers' criticism that was unjustified also in my opinion._

And AC nomination pitches:

> _… had read at least two papers herself to make a more informed decision. In one case this led to noticing reviewers' misunderstanding/mistakes and saved the submission._

> _Thorough summaries, engagement in the reviewers' discussions, clear stands on the papers._

> _This area chair proactively completed all assigned duties well in time, moderated discussions promptly, and even maintained a log of interactions with late reviewers to chase them for completing their tasks in time. He also declared potential COIs upfront, so as to avoid later conflicts._

On behalf of ourselves and the authors - thanks for your help!
